The three associated files contain data from Subsidy Tracker, 
prepared by Good Jobs First.

This data set was made Feb 20, 2023, and contains two data files:
there are 709,050 subsidy records in the "basic" file and
2,899 parent records in the "parent" file.  The parent file
is a summation of data from the basic file together with 
additional information about each parent company.
This dataset is "3.27" in Good Jobs First's internal naming scheme.

Data fields are as follows:

"basic" file:
state char(2) 
program varchar(150)
subsidy_type varchar(100)
agency varchar(150)
sub_year varchar(20)
company varchar(150)

The "subsidy" data field contains the subsidy amount in dollars associated
with the record.  Some records are Megadeals; these records may combine
subsidy amounts from other records.  The medadeal_contrib data field gives
the subsidy amount contribution from the megadeal record that is not 
duplicated by other records.  The subsidy_adjusted data field holds the
subsidy amount for non-megadeal records or the megadeal_contrib amount 
for megadeal records; subsidy_adjusted is the data field that you should
use if you want to add amounts from different records together in order
to avoid double counting amounts. face_loan holds the face value in dollars
of loans and bailout amount (not including repayments) for Federal 
loan records.  A single record will have either a subsidy amount or 
a face_loan amount but not both.

Some records have parent company names assigned by Good Jobs First.  
These records also have a major_industry, which is the industry of the 
parent company, as well as an "industry" which is the more detailed
industrial classification of the parent company.

The unique_id data field identifies each data record.  load_day identifies
the day on which the record was added to the database (early records
have a nominal day). 

Data fields from cfda_program_num down are populated for Federal 
records only, and the unique_transaction_id and last_mod_date apply 
to the Federal data system from which the data were taken, not to
Subsidy Tracker.

The parent file holds parent company totals for those individual subsidy
records that have assigned parents.  parent_name should match
the parent_name within the basic file.  sub_total is the total subsidy amount
for the parent company and num_recs is the number of subsidy records.
"Rank" is the ranking of the parent in descending order by total subsidy 
amount.  The earliest_year shows the earliest subsidy year for any state 
or local subsidy assigned to the parent, while most_data_since_year shows 
the year after which the majority of the state or local data records 
assigned to the parent had their subsidy years.  Federal records for all 
parents were taken from FY2000 and later years.

face_total shows the totals face value of loans and bailouts (not
including repayments) for the parent company.

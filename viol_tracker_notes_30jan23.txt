The three associated files contain data from Violation Tracker, 
prepared by Good Jobs First.

This data set was made Jan 30, 2023, and contains three data files:
there are 546,732 records in the "basic" file; 3,290 parent records 
in the "current_parents" file; and 2,940 parent records in the 
"reporting_date_parents" file. 

The two parent files are summations of data from the basic file, 
together with additional information about the parent companies.

This dataset is "1.51" in Good Jobs First's internal naming scheme.

The dataset now includes two different parent name fields that
have been assigned by Good Jobs First:

1. The current parent name is the ultimate parent company that
owns the entity responsible for the violation at the time that
this dataset was published by Good Jobs First.  This was 
previously referred to as simply the parent name.

2. The reporting_date_parent, or parent at the time of the penalty,
is the ultimate parent company that owned the entity responsible
for the violation at the time of the penalty announcement.  This
is not necessarily the same as the ultimate parent company at the
time that the misconduct occurred.  The date on which the misconduct
occurred is usually not available.

Data fields are as follows:

Basic records are taken from different governmental agencies,
so each record may contain data for a different kind of entity
depending on its source.  Records from EPA's ECHO are individual cases,
records from OSHA are individual inspections, records
from MSHA are individual violations, and other kinds of records
may be individual settlements or court cases.  Some records will include 
penalties that correspond to more than one violation.

Only those records with $5,000 or more in final penalties and that occured since 2000 are included.

Some records contain penalties that overlap with other records.  For 
instance, a DOJ case record may duplicate a regulatory agency record. 
This would lead to double or multiple counting of penalties if they 
were all added up.  To reduce this, Good Jobs First created a 
"sub_penalty" field that subtracts from penalty amounts for all but 
one record in a set of record with duplicate penalties.  The penalty 
amount minus the sub_penalty amount is listed
as penalty_adjusted.  Adding up penalty_adjusted should reduce the 
duplicate penalty problem, although Good Jobs First has only assigned
sub_penalty amounts to records with assigned parent companies.
